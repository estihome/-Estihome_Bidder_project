# project
The major focus of our FYP idea is to use actual factors to generate a 3D model, which will help builders forecast house value and finally by the help of bidding helps to select a builder who is willing to work for us. A 3d modeling platform is created, users can simply drag and drop walls on their selected sqft area of the house. Further it will provide builders a public bidding platform for them to bid on the 3d model which will be posted by users.
